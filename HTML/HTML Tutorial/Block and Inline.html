<p>Chiikawa is gentle, sweet, and kind. <br>
    Cautious to step out of their comfort zone, and somewhat shy, Chiikawa often gets nervous which usually results in anxious tears. <br>
    Thankfully, best friends Hachiware and Usagi always has this cute and small creature’s back. </p>
<p>Hachiware has a big heart, possesses a can-do attitude, and always finds the bright side. <br>
    A true best friend, Hachiware helps Chiikawa overcome fears and makes them feel safe. <br>
    Despite the cat-like ears and the occasional blep, for the record, Hachiware is not necessarily a cat.</p>
